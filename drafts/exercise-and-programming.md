# Exercise & Programming

Alex MacCaw on [exercise and programming](http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/exercise):

> When it comes to self-development, programmers can often be illogical. They spend thousands on conferences, hundreds on books and many hours coding late into the night learning about exciting new technologies. They do all of this to try and improve their brain's ability to program. However, they manage to neglect one of the most significant factors to their brain's performance: exercise.

Alex MacCaw wrote a great post on exercise and programming describing that as programmers we are good at improving our knowledge but yet lack  and how what has worked for him.

Over the years it has been a constant challenge to work out. I've tried different approaches to make it a habit and pretty much they all failed.

Motivating yourself to workout is no easy task. Its the single biggest hurdle I faced and I'm sure many others do too.

Reviewing my past attempts I realized I was to concerned about what to do and track. What exercises am I going to perform? Am I working out lower or upper body? Cardio? Is it an off day? To much noise. To many concerns for just starting off that it becomes a burden and thus ruined any motivation I had.

Instead I decided to change my focus. Each day I had just one simple objective: going to the gym. That's it. Nothing else mattered. Now all those questions didn't matter anymore. Any pressure I had was gone.

With that change I've been working out every weekday for the past few months. Doesn't matter if its an intense 45 minute workout or just a simple 10 minute run. My only objective is to get in the gym. That a lot less intimadating and easier to accomplish.

If I can do a full workout (30-45 mins) then great. If not a single 10 minute run will suffice. My only objective is to get in the gym. That's the hardest part. Once you're there.. well you made it right? Might as well workout.



A solution that has helped me is to start off each day with one simple objective: going to the gym. That's it. This has been my single biggest hurdle and I'm sure it is for many others.

I realized that with this simple objective I took an immense amount of pressure and tension off myself. I wasn't worried about the details. 

The single hardest part for me has simply been going to the gym. 

It can be difficult to motivate yourself to workout when there's so much to do and track. A solution that has helped me is to start off each day with one simple objective: going to the gym. That's it. I don't worry about what exercises I'll do, whether I'm working out lower or upper body, am doing cardo, or if its an off day. Forget about all of it! Just go to the gym.

You'd be amazed at how just a 10-15 minute run will make a huge difference in how you feel for the rest of the day.

I remind myself of how great feel during and after working out. That feeling soon becomes very addicting that going to the gym now becomes a habit.

I choose to workout every weekday. If I can do a full workout (30-45 mins) then great. If not a single 10 minute run will suffice. My only objective is to get in the gym. That's the hardest part. Once you're there.. well you made it right? Might as well workout.

Remind yourself each day how great you'll feel during and after your workout. This feeling becomes very addicting.

Once its a good habit you'll notice you feel better. More energetic. You come into work with a positive attitude, willing to take on any task. I've worked on projects I didn't want too but after a workout I'm so focused on the task at hand its long forgotten.


- easy to ditch the habit or not have the willpower to go so what helps?
- first off just focus on going to the gym
- don't worry about what workouts to do
- focus on the habit of going and simply doing some exercise
- even if its just a 15 minute run, that's great!
- the objective is to make it a good habit
- over time you'll be better prepared to mix up your workout
- even if you do just a 15 minute run it will make all the difference
- you will feel great during and after
- constantly remind yourself of that and it becomes easier to go workout
- you'll come into work with a positive attitude ready to take on any task
- I've come in and worked on tasks I didn't want too but after a workout that feeling goes away, you just focus much better on the task at hand
