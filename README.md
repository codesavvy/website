= My Website

I've moved my website from a traditional web host built using ColdFusion to Ruby and using Sinatra. I back up my site with Git and deploy it using Heroku. I've found this much easier and what I'm used to doing everyday, I figure its better than dealing with FTP. I love it so far. I've had a great time learning a little Sinatra and using Heroku. Couldn't be any easier.
