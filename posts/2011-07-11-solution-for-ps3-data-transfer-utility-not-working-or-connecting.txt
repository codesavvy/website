title: Solution for PS3 data transfer utility not working or connecting

This weekend I was setting up my new PS3 Slim and needed to transfer the data I have from my old 80GB PS3. I had run into some trouble where I set everything up and then told the source PS3 (the 80GB) to transfer data to the new one and it would just sit there and eventually time out and then basically saying the PS3's aren't connected via ethernet cable when they were. I followed [instruction manual](http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/transferutility.html) but after [researching online at least 2 key steps were missing](http://community.us.playstation.com/message/28301009#28301009) from the directions.

Make sure you DISABLE both the Internet Connection and Media Server Connection on both systems. Once I did this the data transfer worked. On each system do the following:

*  Select (Settings) > (Network Settings) > (Internet Connection) and then Disabled
*  Select (Settings) > (Network Settings) > (Media Server Connection) and then Disabled

When you attempt to transfer the data again for me the connection took several minutes to happen (I'd say about 5-10 minutes) so be patient!
