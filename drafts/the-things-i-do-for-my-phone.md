# The Things I Do For My iPhone

While I don't have a Steve Jobs experience to share, I did have an incident with my iPhone a few years ago that reminded me of how much I love not just that device but Apple products in general.

Whenever I'm on the subway platform waiting I pull out my phone and start reading articles I have saved with Instapaper. One day the phone slipped out of my hands as I brought it up close to read. It fell on the edge of the platform and then on the tracks below.

For a second my heart sank but I knew better. I turned to my right as I was close to the end of the platform where their is a small gate into the subway tunnel. I could walk on to the tracks, pick up my phone and come back the same way. One problem. The train was arriving in less than 2 minutes.

While that thought came to mind, two men just a few feet away told me a better idea. Jump! I did the math. Their idea was faster. So I jumped! Did you think I was going to leave my phone there? No way!

I picked up my phone and the two men lifted me back up on the platform all in a few seconds. Two complete strangers were kind enough to help without asking. 

What I left out at first is that was an iPhone 3G. I have an iPhone 4 now. I dread finding out what crazy thing I'll do next if something happens to it. I love my iPhone.
