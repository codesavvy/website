<p><span class="figure"><img src="/images/javier.jpg" alt="Javier Julio" width="78" height="100" /></span>Hello, I'm Javier Julio. A software developer and speaker living in Brooklyn, New York. I create rich applications for the web, mobile, and desktop environments at <a href="http://www.9mmedia.com/">9mmedia</a> in the trendy Soho neighborhood of Manhattan.</p>

<p>For the past 3 years, I've specialized as a client side developer working with Flex but I started off server side and consider myself proficient in both. If my focus goes one way, on my free time, I focus on the other. Currently, I'm learning Ruby by completing the <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">Ruby Koans</a> and enjoying it immensely. You can find my notes and other projects on <a href="http://github.com/javierjulio">GitHub</a>. Ruby's syntax is wonderful and the great set of tools in the community like <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> have won me over. Otherwise I'd be learning Node.js and Clojure. Those are next.</p>

<p>Apart from programming, I'm an avid reader and use <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> to read anything I come across using Google Reader or Twitter. Using Netflix I've discovered shows and movies I wouldn't have otherwise. When that bores me safe to say I'll be gaming. You can find me on <a href="http://us.playstation.com/publictrophy/index.htm?onlinename=JJfutbol">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjfutbol">Steam</a> as JJfutbol. Add me and lets game!</p>

<p>My futbol teams are Newcastle United and Valencia. The first is to long of a story and the second is because my mother is from there. I traveled to Valencia each summer as a child and that's how I learned to speak Spanish fluently. And thanks to her, I love to <a href="/recipes">cook</a>. Its relaxing and a great way to clear the mind.</p>
