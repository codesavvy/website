title: Git tagging a forked Ruby gem project for Bundler

If you ever have to customize or patch a Ruby gem and you are using Bundler, its a good idea when forking that project to create a branch and then [tag new releases](http://gitref.org/branching/#tag).

I found this out recently as I used two Ruby gems, databasedotcom and salesforce_bulk, to sync data to Salesforce for reporting. I ran into showstoppers with both but luckily they are hosted on GitHub so I was able to fork them and make the necessary changes to resolve the issues I encountered while being able to contribute those changes back.

The project ```Gemfile``` was updated with my two forked git branches and then I ran ```bundle install```. While Bundler does support specifying a git branch I found that as I made further code updates and would run ```bundle install``` again, Bundler wouldn't download those changes. I figured out that I should be [tagging releases of that branch](http://gitref.org/branching/#tag) instead as that would require the ```Gemfile``` to be updated with a new tag name. After that running ```bundle install``` would download the latest changes I made.
